This is a set of tools used for most of my projects that use communications over the internet. Also this adds additional useful utilities to complete various tasks in a standardized way. This allows all of my plugins/mods/projects to work together in unison.

Coming soon!
- Socket communication API, for communicationg with webpages(php...)
- Channel handling improvements, standardized send/recieve
- Consolidated Channel handler that is universal
- Packet dispatch/formatter
- Packet Creator
- Work on Travis CI build check
